# contactlistapp
Contact List using AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS &amp; MongoDB

I have made this app by following this tutorial: Learn Coding Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHV7gOHvNdk)

Features: 
1. You can add a contact by giving Name, Email & Number
2. You can remove a contact
3. You can edit a contact
4. For Edit I have made a small change which was not discussed in the tutorial. If a user clicks Edit button, I have disabled the Add Contact button. So that there would be no glitch in the app. If a user clicks on Clear button, it will enable the Add Contact button. (This particular feature has been added from UX point of view).
